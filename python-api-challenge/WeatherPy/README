Observations

1. As the latitude in the northern hemisphere decreases, the temperature is more likely to increase. This is expected because you are moving closer to the Equator
as the latitude decreases. 

2. As latitude in the southern hemisphere increases, the temperature is also more likely to increase. This is also expected because you are moving towards the Equator 
as the latitude increases. 

3. There seems to be very little correlation between latitude and humidity for both hemispheres. Humidity is likely more influenced by factors such as weather patterns
and proximity to large bodies of water than by latitude.
